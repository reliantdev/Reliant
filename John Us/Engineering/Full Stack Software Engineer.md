- Creativity and Initiative: Feel free to impress us with your approach to solving user needs.
- Technical Proficiency: Show off your coding skills and your ability to work with different technologies and frameworks.
- Problem Solving: We're interested in your thought process and how you tackle challenges in software development.
- Understanding of Web Fundamentals: Demonstrate your grasp of how web servers and browsers communicate and interact, and how to effectively separate front-end and back-end concerns.

This is your opportunity to shine and demonstrate why you're the right fit for our team. We look forward to seeing your innovative solutions and discussing your development choices.

Good luck, and most importantly, have fun with it!

## User Support Ticket System

Project Brief: User Support Ticket System

Objective: Build a simple user support ticket system that allows users to create, view, and update support tickets.

Requirements:
1. User Interface (Front-end)
    - Ticket Submission Form: Allows users to submit new support tickets with fields for the title, description, and priority level.
    - Ticket Dashboard: A view to list all tickets with basic filtering capabilities (e.g., by status or priority).
    - Ticket Details View: Users can click on a ticket in the dashboard to view full details and update the status of the ticket (e.g., Open, In Progress, Resolved).
2. Server-side (Back-end)
    - API Endpoints:
      - POST /tickets to submit a new ticket.
      - GET /tickets to retrieve all tickets.
      - GET /tickets/{id} to retrieve a specific ticket's details.
      - PUT /tickets/{id} to update a ticketâ€™s status.
    - Data Storage: Implement simple data storage to persist tickets. This can be a database or an in-memory solution for simplicity.

3. Documentation:
    - A brief explanation of the architecture.
    - Setup and installation instructions.
    - A simple discussion of the decision-making process behind the chosen technologies and design.


Optional Extensions:

- Implement authentication for users to only view and edit their tickets.
- Add real-time updates to the dashboard using WebSockets.
- Deploy the application to a cloud provider like Azure, using Azure Web Apps or Containers.|


## Deliverables

#### Instructions for GitHub Submission:
- Create a Repository: Set up a public GitHub repository specifically for this project.
- Commit Regularly: Make regular commits to document the development process. This helps us see how you approached the project step-by-step.
- README File: Include a README.md file in your repository with:
  - An overview of the project.
  - Instructions on how to set up and run your application.
  - A brief discussion of the technologies used and the reasons behind your architectural decisions.
- Final Commit: Ensure everything is committed before you submit the link to us.

#### Alternative Submission Methods:

While GitHub is our preferred platform, you are welcome to use any other code-sharing or version control system you are comfortable with. If you choose another method, please ensure that:
- You provide all necessary files and detailed instructions on how to set up and run your project.
- Your code is easily accessible and can be reviewed by our team without requiring special permissions.
